**Exam Fraud Detection Project**

This project is entirely implemented using Google Colab and aims to tackle fraudulent activities during exams in examination halls. Employing machine learning algorithms, specifically the 
Haarcascade algorithm for face detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting student names and photos from exam materials, the system conducts a meticulous verification 
process. The process involves three comparisons: the current webcam photo is compared against the hall ticket photo and the database photo. Additionally, the system cross-checks the 
associated names for consistency between the database and the hall ticket. If all three photo comparisons and name verifications align, the student's exam integrity is confirmed. However, 
any discrepancies detected during this process are indicative of potential fraud, prompting immediate alerts to the overseeing exam authorities. This comprehensive approach enhances exam 
security and provides a robust mechanism for the early detection of fraudulent activities.
